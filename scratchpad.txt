Todos
=====
- Production build
 - webpack


Daily Kidcompy developer steps
==============================
1. 'git pull'
2. Add any new ideas you have for features or technical work items to the parking lot so we can discuss and prioritize them
3. Identify work items from Todos that will be worked on today, update or elaborate as needed
4. In a terminal, run 'gulp dev' (or 'gulp integration' if you want to TDD with the integration tests as well)
  * Once Karma starts, capture more browsers for running tests as needed by going to http://localhost:9876/
  * Once the Harness starts, harness more browsers as needed by going to http://localhost:8080/
5. TDD+H:  Red, Green, Refactor, Harness
  * Little 'git commit's as you go, baby steps.
  * The code should always pass tests/bundle successfully or it should be disabled with a feature toggle before commit
  * The harness is a sandbox for the feature you are working on.  Use it to experiment with css styles, scripts and markup
6. At the end of the day or when a work item is complete
  * Tweak feature toggles if necessary, is it time to enable previously dev-only flags in production builds?
  * Spot check that the harness app is still functional
  * 'gulp build' and make sure all lints and tests pass
7. If the status of work items changed, update scratchpad.txt accordingly
8. Do any final commits and 'git push'
9. Update any issue tickets at github or tag releases as needed
10. Repeat or go to bed  ;)


Parking lot or rocket science stuff that is too much research/effort to work on immediately

Annoying things that annoy me
=============================
- On windows, it seems like the ctrl-c handler doesn't allow me to shutdown the web driver for the code harness.  Windows devs will
have to close the harness Firefox instance manually.
