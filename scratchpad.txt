Annoying things that annoy me
=============================
- The gulp process does not die when I ctrl-c with 'gulp dev', have to manually kill that process - is this a bug with
gulp or with io.js?
- Firebug does not open automagically when the kidcompy harness window/tab launches from 'gulp dev', I suspect Firebug
has a bug with launching on a first time window because firebug does autostart when I open a new tab in the harness window.
  - this seems to be intermittent, I've seen it succeed
